    "In this series of exercise I am going to use a Neural Network to perform machine learning regression on a set of data, and then utilize the same network to make prediction according to the trained model. This task is a subset of a more general problem class, known as Prediction Problems. Such problems can be articulated as follow:\n",
    "> Consider a probabilistic process that gives rise to labeled data $(x,y)$. The data is generated by drawing samples from the equation $$y_i= f(x_i) + \\eta_i,$$ where $f(x_i)$ is some fixed, but (possibly unknown) function, and $\\eta_i$ is a Gaussian, uncorrelated noise variable such that $$\\langle \\eta_i \\rangle=0 \\\\ \\langle \\eta_i \\eta_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij} \\sigma$$\n",
    "Can we then predict some new values $y_i'$ given some arbitrary inputs $x_i'$, without necessarily knowing $f$? \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a neural network should, in theory, be a universal approximator, it should be capable of \"learning\", given some train $x_i,y_i$ inputs, the target function $f$ and, subsequently, predict new values corresponding to never-seen inputs. My goal will then be to explore how well this statement holds for three different $f$, and how the predictions change when varying the network parameters. \n"
