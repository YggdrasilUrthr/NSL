# NSL Exercises

I included in this repository all the exercises requested for the Numerical Simulation Library, attended during the year 2022/2023. In each folder it can be found the code used for the simulation, written in C++, alongside a jupyter notebook where I summarized and commented the obtained results.

## Compilation and execution

In order to compile the code it is necessary to run the command `make` in each sub-directory. The compiled code can then be executed via `./Ex_x_y.out` where `x` is the Lab number and `y` is the sub-exercise number. In some directories, where a different execution procedure is needed, I included a specific `README` file.
