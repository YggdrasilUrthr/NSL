# Numerical Exercises 8

The C++ code included in the current folder can be compiled and executed using the same procedure described in the main repository `README` file. To automate the calibration and simulation processes I also included two bash scripts:

- `run_calib.sh`: compute and dump the calibration data needed to determine the blocks size.
- `run_sim.sh`: run the actual simulation step and move the data to an appropriate folder.

All the scripts can be run by using the command `sh script_name.sh`.
